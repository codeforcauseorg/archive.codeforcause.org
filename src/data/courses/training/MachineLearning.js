  overview: [
    'Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome.',
    'We follow the onion peeling approach to create a level order approach towards such great technologies. You do not have to mug up a lot of formulas and maths to become great at machine learning. Understanding what can be done and how to proceed with understanding what is important and start exploring it the right way. We will guide you to build your career in machine learning.'
